                "question": "What is the portal for?",
                "answer": "The platform uaSOS.org connects refugees looking for accommodation with private individuals, institutions, NGOs and companies offering accommodation. Unlike other initiatives that collect similar data, the uaSOS.org platform automatically connects the announcements of those in need with offers of help in order to provide the best possible assistance to the widest possible group of people. Thanks to the platform, people in need will not have to browse hundreds of available offers of help, but will be presented with the most appropriate and up-to-date one, tailored to their needs. Registration on the platform is not anonymous, which provides security to both parties."

The platform was created with the participation of dozens of volunteers and is based on an advanced engine, which in the future gives the possibility of developing the platform to serve other needs (e.g. transport)."
